# 📡 Digital Communication System Simulation in Python

## 📘 Overview
This project presents an end-to-end simulation of a modern digital communication system implemented in Python.  
It was developed as part of the **Communication Systems** course at the **Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology**.

The system simulates how information is encoded, transmitted through a noisy channel, and recovered at the receiver while analyzing performance under different modulation and noise conditions.

This project demonstrates practical skills in telecommunications, signal processing, and Python-based system simulation.
